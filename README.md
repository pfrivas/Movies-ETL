# Movies-ETL

## Purpose

This analysis was conducted in order to help a large movie streaming platform that was preparing for a hackathon in order to determine which movies were going to be the biggest successes so that they could buy the streaming rights.
- several large datasets form wikipedia and kaggle needed to be cleaned and prepared for use by the participants of the hackathon.

The focus of this project was to build a program that would take in large sources of data, clean, merge, and then export them to a SQL server, in order for them to be ready for analysis.
- This was done through large data Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) using pandas, regex, and export to an SQL database

## Resources
- Pandas 
- Regex
- Python
- pgadmin4
- SQL database
